# Torch Jaekwon
This is my personal repository for the efficiency of my research.

## Set up
* Clone the repository.
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/jakeoneijk/TorchJaekwon
    ```
* Copy the files and directories in 'cp' to the new project directory.
    ```
    .
    └── TorchJaekwon
        └── cp
    ```
* (Optional) If you are a vscode user change dir name `vscode` to `.vscode`.
